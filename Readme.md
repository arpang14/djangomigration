**Rollback All Migrations for an App**
If you want to roll back all migrations for an app (resetting it to an unmigrated state), specify zero as the migration name:


python manage.py migrate app_name zero
In Django, you can execute custom Python code during a migration by using the RunPython operation. This allows you to write Python code that runs as part of the migration process, such as data migrations or other custom logic.


**Rolling back migrations**
If you want to roll back all migrations for an app (reset it to an unmigrated state), specify zero as the migration name:


python manage.py migrate app_name zero


Data Loss: Rolling back migrations might result in data loss if the migration involves deleting fields, tables, or data.

Irreversible Migrations: If a migration is marked as irreversible (e.g., a RunPython operation without a reverse function), Django will raise an error when you attempt to roll it back.

Backup: Always back up your database before rolling back migrations, especially in production environments.
